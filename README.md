- 👋 Hi, I am Charles. I come from Poland.

- 👀 I am interested in programming, mainly games programming. I also like to read a bit about electronics. As a mattera of a break from work and passion, 
  I resort to physical effort. I have been practicing ballroom dance for over 2 years. 

- 🌱 I am currently learning C++ and Python. C++ is my favorite language and seems to be a great choice for PC games.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on game and application projects related to C ++ or Python. I am looking for opportunities to develop and gain experience. 

- 📫 How to reach me?
  write an email to: carolinii.contact@gmail.com

### Feel free to open assignments with new suggestions, bugs found, or just comments on my projects.
